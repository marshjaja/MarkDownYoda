# 🖇️PROJECT DEMO
https://www.loom.com/share/421e988e5cdb418f9cf580b62d9c949c

---

# 📖DESCRIPTION

As per the homework requirements, the goal was to develop an automated tool to streamline the README creation process. <br>
The objective was to craft README files that adhere to the standards outlined in the 'Good README Guide.' <br>
These high-quality READMEs should include essential information such as the project's description, usage instructions, installation procedures, contact info, and instructions for contributions etc.

---

# 🗣️USER STORY
- As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
<br>

---

# ✅ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

- The title of my project<br>
- Sections entitled: <br>
  - Description <br>
  - Table of Contents <br>
  - Installation
  - Usage
  - License
  - Contributing
  - Tests
  - Questions (I have used 'Contact' (instead of 'Question') as I thought that would be more appropriat)


- When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
- When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
- When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
- When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
